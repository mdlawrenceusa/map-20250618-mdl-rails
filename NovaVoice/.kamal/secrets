# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password, env/secret, builder/secrets,
# and accessories/*/env/secret in config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either
# password manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file needs to be safe for git.

# Example of extracting secrets from 1password (or another compatible pw manager)
# SECRETS=$(kamal secrets fetch --adapter 1password --account your-account --from Vault/Item KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD RAILS_MASTER_KEY)
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(kamal secrets extract KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD ${SECRETS})
# RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(kamal secrets extract RAILS_MASTER_KEY ${SECRETS})

# Minimal secrets for Kamal deployment
# All application credentials are handled via AWS Secrets Manager and IAM roles

# AWS ECR registry password (dynamically retrieved)
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1)

# Note: All other credentials (Rails secrets, database, Vonage) are retrieved
# at runtime from AWS Secrets Manager using IAM role-based authentication
# This follows security best practices with least privilege access
